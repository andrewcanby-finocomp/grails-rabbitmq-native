== Changelog

=== 3.5.x

==== Version 3.5.0
* Update to work with Grails 3.3 (or better).
* Add `Order` and `Ordered` support to message converters.

=== 3.4.x

==== Version
==== Version 3.4.6
* Add some error handling around flushing and destroying the persistence context interceptor. Was unable
  to reproduce the error, but this is an attempt to fix a zombie Hibernate session bug.

==== Version 3.4.5
* Added rabbitmq prefix, to avoid conflicts with environment variables. (http://github.com/budjb/grails-rabbitmq-native/issues/130[#130])

==== Version 3.4.4
* Move the `TypeConvertertingMapConverter` to a higher converting priority than `JsonConverter`.

==== Version 3.4.3
* Add top-level exception handling for the internal message handler implementation. This fixes an issue
  where Hibernate exceptions closed RabbitMQ channels.
* Use a different `MimeType` constructor with built-in message converters to maintain Grails 3.1.x support.

==== Version 3.4.2
* Add configuration option `rabbitmq.enableSerializableConverter`, which defaults to `false`. This breaks behavior
  with the previous 3.4.x releases but brings it back inline with the behavior of previous versions. This was done
  due to unexpected serialization issues with embedded lazy maps returned from the `JsonSlurper`.

==== Version 3.4.1
* Change from using Spring's `MimeType.getCharset()` to `MimeType.getCharSet()`. The latter is deprecated but
  using it allows Grails 3.1.x to function correctly.

==== Version 3.4.0
* Remove support for legacy connection configuration (`rabbitmq.connection`).
* Update RabbitMQ Client library to 4.2.0.
* Add support for exporting RabbitMQ metrics.
* Major refactor of the message converter system. These changes are not backwards compatible.
* Major refactor of the message consumer backend system. Existing consumers are compatible.
* Migrate documentation to AsciiDoc.
* Introduce new interfaces for message consumers (`UnsupportedMessageHandler` and `MessageConsumerEventHandler`).
* Added Spring application events for RabbitMQ plugin system start and stop events.

=== 3.3.x

==== Version 3.3.3
* Upgrade codebase to Grails 3.2.
* Add ability to bind exchanges to exchanges.
* Migrate from `Calendar` to `OffsetDateTime` for message timestamps.
* Update amqp-client to version 3.6.6. (http://github.com/budjb/grails-rabbitmq-native/issues/83[#83])

==== Version 3.3.2
* Fix message converter/consumer handler issue where message handler methods with primitive types
  (such as `int`) would not accept the equivalent boxed type (such as `Integer`).

==== Version 3.3.1
* Reintroduce support for consumer handler methods taking only the `MessageContext` as a parameter.

==== Version 3.3.0
[WARNING]
==== Version
This version includes changes to the configuration format introduced in 3.2.0. There were issues with YAML configuration
and using the keys as the names of connection, queues, or exchanges where those names had periods in them. There was
no way to escape them, and it broke the configuration parsing code. Due to this, the format had to change. This
decision was not made lightly and I intend on this being the last change to the configuration format.
==== Version
* Changed the configuration format introduced in 3.2.0. This breaks backward compatibility with that version.

NOTE: A huge thanks to https://github.com/olliefreeman[Ollie Freeman] for his work on this release.

* First non-beta release of the plugin for Grails 3.
* Deprecate closure-based queue/exchange configuration.
* Add new map-based configuration that works well with YAML.
* Removed `RabbitMessageBuilder`.

=== 3.1.x

==== Version 3.1.2-beta
* Experimental upgrade to Grails 3.

==== Version 3.1.2

==== Version 3.1.1

  consumer is annotated with `@Transactional`.
  (http://github.com/budjb/grails-rabbitmq-native/issues/55[#55])
* Add setter methods for the message TTL (`expiration`).
  (http://github.com/budjb/grails-rabbitmq-native/issues/56[#56])
* Fix bug where missing connection configuration values do not allow the use of default values.

* Added the ability to start and stop individual consumers.
  (http://github.com/budjb/grails-rabbitmq-native/issues/49[#49])
* Added the ability to start and stop consumers based on the connection they're tied to.
  (http://github.com/budjb/grails-rabbitmq-native/issues/49[#49])
* Moved consumer adapter storage from the connection context to the consumer manager.
* Handle `Throwable` types that were not being handled before in the consumer handling so that channels are not closed
  if one of the unhandled errors occurs.
  (http://github.com/budjb/grails-rabbitmq-native/issues/47[#47])
* Added travis-ci continuous integration for all commits to the plugin.

=== 1.0.x

==== Version 1.0.3
* Modified the logic to check for the existence of callbacks in consumers.

==== Version 1.0.2
