=== From 3.5.X

The upgrade from 3.5.X to 4.0.X is essentially a drop-in replacement if migrating from a Grails 3.x Application to a
Grails 4.x Application.

On the chance that your application is looking for the *NullArgumentException* that occurred during startup if the
*RabbitContext* was `null`, this will need to be changed to look for a *NullPointerException* instead.
